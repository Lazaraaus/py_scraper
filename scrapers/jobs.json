Jerry, with his father, brother and a partner, grew the business, with typical start up challenges, to a $25 million annual revenue in 1984. With the passing of Jerry\u2019s father, Carl Moyes, Jerry became the sole owner. By 1990, Swift had grown to a $125 million carrier with 800 trucks. Swift\u2019s significant revenue growth is attributable to internal growth with existing customers as well as acquisitions. Since 1988, Swift has acquired 13 different motor carriers. Today, Swift generates over $4 billion in revenue and operates nearly 20,000 trucks. Swift\u2019s terminal network has grown to over forty full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico. Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico based carrier.
